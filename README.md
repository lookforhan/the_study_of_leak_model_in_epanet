# the_study_of_leak_model_in_epanet

We proposed three kind of break models including 2-reservoir model, single-reservoir model, 2-emitter model. These models are tested in a modena network. The results shows that
1. 2-reservoir model and 2-emitter model are more reasonable than single-reservoir model;
2. the negative node pressure is found in each kind of model;
3. there is no significant difference between the models;
4. the model sort by the leakage are the 2-reservoir model, 2-emitter model, 1-reservoir model.
